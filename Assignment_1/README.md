# COMP5318-MachineLearning Assignment 1
University Coursework for COMP5318: Machine Learning and Data Mining (Semester 2, 2019)

The assignment was completed as part of the COMP5318 unit of The University of Sydney by [Sanna Nazir](https://github.com/Sanna-Nazir), [Anshu Kumar](https://github.com/anshukr5) and [Samarth Sehgal](https://github.com/samarthsehgal97). 

The aim of this project and the report may be divided into two separate levels:

Microscopically, at a student level, the project is aimed at inculcating machine learning skills in the student. By performing each sub-step of the project, ranging from data cleaning to final predictions using the classifiers built; the student is expected to gain diverse skills required for implementing the classroom skills on real-life problems. Furthermore, by designing of various separate classifier, the goal of critical thinking and analysis at the student level is hoped to be achieved. Summarizing the experiments, their results and final conclusion of choice of a classifier based on various trade-off factors is aimed at developing essential analytical skills.

Macroscopically, the study is aimed at understanding the growing need for image-based classifiers in the realm of technology. With the explosion of data in the modern world coupled with the growing propensity of consumers for digital shopping trends, e-commerce has seen an exponential growth. A key task in building such e-commerce platforms would be the segregation of garments in various classes of human-understandable sections for instance, a section for pants and a separate one for pants. By executing this project and assignment, the student can become efficient in such a task of specific textile classification based on images.

More specifically, the microscopic aims of this project may be defined as: 
---1. Analysing the raw dataset. 
---2. Dividing the annotated dataset into training and validation set. 
---3. Pre-processing the data for better performance. 
---4. Studying different Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms and selecting those that solve the given problem domain with high accuracy. 
---5. Creating the required classifiers and carry out the experimentation 
---6. Comparison of techniques and draw educated inferences from the same. 
---7. Concluding the study with closing remarks and personal reflection.
