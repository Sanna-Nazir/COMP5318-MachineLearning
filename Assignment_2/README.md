# COMP5318-MachineLearning Assignment 2
University Coursework for COMP5318: Machine Learning and Data Mining (Semester 2, 2019)

The assignment was completed as part of the COMP5318 unit of The University of Sydney by [Sanna Nazir](https://github.com/Sanna-Nazir), [Anshu Kumar](https://github.com/anshukr5) and [Samarth Sehgal](https://github.com/samarthsehgal97). 

The aim of this project and the report may be divided into two separate levels:

At the student level, the project is aimed at inculcating technical and analytical skills within the student. Each step of the project, starting with the choice of a problem statement to discussing and analyzing the best solutions for that problem, the project is designed to educate the student about various techniques available to deal with the same. The core focus being development of essential data analysis skills as well as associated business and analytical acumen. 

At a macroscopic level, the project is aimed at understanding the significance of technological solutions to real-world problems. In case of the forest fire dataset, this problem is the creation of robust, efficient and effective techniques for controlling such disasters. 
Global warming is a scientifically proven and physically experienced phenomenon of the 21st century. In the future, under a warmer climate, it is expected that there will be more severe fire weather, more area burned, more ignitions and a longer fire season [7]. To better understand allocation of resources for such instances, predicting the affected land is very important. To predict the same, environmental as well as geographic features are of paramount importance. Thus, with the exploration of this study, such a task can be achieved.


More specifically, the microscopic aims of this project may be defined as: 
  1. Selection of the dataset. Here, chosen dataset is Forest Fires Dataset.
  2. Dividing the annotated dataset into training and validation set. 
  3. Pre-processing the data for better performance. 
  4. Studying different Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms and selecting those that solve the given problem domain with high accuracy. 
  5. Perform experiments to analyze the performance of various regression techniques on the same to predict the burned/affected area due to a fire, given environmental and geographical parameters.
  6. Concluding the study with closing remarks and personal reflection.
